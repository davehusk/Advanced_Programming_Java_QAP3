## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the solutions for the **Quantitative Assessment Practice (QAP) 3** for the **Advanced Programming (Java)** course. The assignment covers key Java concepts, including:

- **Inheritance** (Problem 1)
- **Polymorphism** (Problem 2)
- **Abstract Classes** (Problem 3)
- **Interfaces** (Problem 4)

Each problem is implemented with **input validation**, **edge case handling**, and **additional functionality** to demonstrate mastery of the subject matter.

## **Directory Structure**
The project is organized into four folders, one for each problem:

```
Advanced_Programming_Java_QAP3/
├── Problem1/              # Inheritance (Person, Student, Teacher, CollegeStudent)
├── Problem2/              # Polymorphism (Point, MovablePoint)
├── Problem3/              # Abstract Classes (Shapes)
├── Problem4/              # Interfaces (Scalable Shapes)
```

---

## **How to Run the Code**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davehusk/Advanced_Programming_Java_QAP3.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the problem folder (e.g., `Problem1`):
   ```bash
   cd Problem1
   ```
3. Compile and run the `Demo.java` file:
   ```bash
   javac Demo.java
   java Demo
   ```

## **Key Features**
- **Problem 1**: Implementation of inheritance with `Person`, `Student`, `Teacher`, and `CollegeStudent` classes. Includes input validation and additional methods like `isHonorRoll()` and `getMonthlySalary()`.
- **Problem 2**: Implementation of polymorphism with `Point` and `MovablePoint` classes. Includes methods like `distanceTo()` and `isMovingDiagonally()`.
- **Problem 3**: Implementation of abstract classes for shapes (`Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Triangle`, `EquilateralTriangle`). Includes methods like `isRegular()` and `getAspectRatio()`.
- **Problem 4**: Implementation of the `Scalable` interface to scale shapes. Includes a static method to scale all shapes in an array.
