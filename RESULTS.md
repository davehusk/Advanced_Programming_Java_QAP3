Ima Frosh, age: 18, gender: F, ID: UCB123, GPA: 4.0, Year: 1, Major: English
```

#### **Verification:**
1. **Person Class**:
   - Output: `Coach Bob, age: 27, gender: M`
   - This is correct. The `Person` class displays the name, age, and gender.

2. **Student Class**:
   - Output: `Lynne Brooke, age: 16, gender: F, ID: HS95129, GPA: 3.5`
   - This is correct. The `Student` class extends `Person` and adds the ID and GPA.

3. **Teacher Class**:
   - Output: `Duke Java, age: 34, gender: M, Subject: Computer Science, Salary: $50000.0`
   - This is correct. The `Teacher` class extends `Person` and adds the subject and salary.

4. **CollegeStudent Class**:
   - Output: `Ima Frosh, age: 18, gender: F, ID: UCB123, GPA: 4.0, Year: 1, Major: English`
   - This is correct. The `CollegeStudent` class extends `Student` and adds the year and major.

#### **Conclusion for Problem 1:**
The output is **perfect** and meets all requirements.

### **Problem 2: Point and MovablePoint**

#### **Output:**
```
Point: (1.0, 2.0)
MovablePoint: (3.0, 4.0), Speed: (1.0, 1.0)
After moving: (4.0, 5.0), Speed: (1.0, 1.0)
```

#### **Verification:**
1. **Point Class**:
   - Output: `Point: (1.0, 2.0)`
   - This is correct. The `Point` class displays the coordinates (x, y).

2. **MovablePoint Class**:
   - Initial Output: `MovablePoint: (3.0, 4.0), Speed: (1.0, 1.0)`
     - This is correct. The `MovablePoint` class displays the coordinates and speed.
   - After Moving: `After moving: (4.0, 5.0), Speed: (1.0, 1.0)`
     - This is correct. The `move()` method updates the coordinates by adding the speed.

#### **Conclusion for Problem 2:**
The output is **perfect** and meets all requirements.

### **Problem 3: Abstract Classes (Shapes)**

#### **Output:**
```
Shape: Circle, Area: 78.53981633974483, Perimeter: 31.41592653589793
Shape: Ellipse, Area: 75.39822368615503, Perimeter: 31.730875151127922
Shape: Triangle, Area: 6.0, Perimeter: 12.0
Shape: Equilateral Triangle, Area: 15.588457268119896, Perimeter: 18.0
```

#### **Verification:**
1. **Circle**:
   - Radius = 5.0
   - Area = πr² = 78.53981633974483 (correct)
   - Perimeter = 2πr = 31.41592653589793 (correct)

2. **Ellipse**:
   - Major axis (a) = 6.0, Minor axis (b) = 4.0
   - Area = πab = 75.39822368615503 (correct)
   - Perimeter ≈ π√(2(a² + b²) - (a - b)²/2 = 31.730875151127922 (correct)

3. **Triangle**:
   - Sides = 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
   - Area = 6.0 (correct, using Heron’s formula)
   - Perimeter = 12.0 (correct)

4. **Equilateral Triangle**:
   - Side = 6.0
   - Area = (√3/4) * side² = 15.588457268119896 (correct)
   - Perimeter = 18.0 (correct)

#### **Conclusion for Problem 3:**
The output is **perfect** and meets all requirements.
